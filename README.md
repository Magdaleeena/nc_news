For instructions, on how to create a environment variables for anyone who wishes to clone my project and run it locally.
1. Create a file named .env.test in the root directory of the project for your test database.
2. Inside of that test file that you have just created add PGDATABASE=nc_news_test.
3. Create a file named .env.development in the root directory of the project for your dev database.
4. Inside of that development file similarly as before add PGDATABASE=nc_news.
5. The config is already required in the connection file inside db.
